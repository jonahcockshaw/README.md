## About Me

Since getting kicked out of school and dropping out of college, I've been entirely self-taught in everything I do. My key areas of interest are Marketing, Sales, Data Analysis, Automation and Web Development. I've been dabbling with websites since I was around 13 years old, and helping businesses with their online marketing since I was around 16. 

I currently run fitmedia.net, which is a performance marketing agency working within the health & fitness sector. We build sales funnels, run paid ads and collect data to better inform our decision making. We help our clients increase their lead-flow, make more money and grow a more profitable business. We handle the critical components of growth so that they can focus on delivering life-changing services.

Outside of this I also work on a number of other projects, and with businesses outside of the health & fitness industry on a freelance / consulting basis.
